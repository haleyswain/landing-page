        <h1>Welcome to my landing page!</h1>
        <h3> From this site, I hope you will be able to learn more about me, and why I decided to learn how to code!</h3>
        <h2> About me!</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I am from Montana! I recently moved to Portland from the great state of Montana, where we still sometimes ride our horses to school!</li>
            <li> I love to travel! I have visited 14 coutries, and studied in Europe for 7 months in 2015. </li>
            <li> I just graduated! In May, I received my bachelor's degree in International Business from the University of Montana. (Go Griz!) I hope to use my skills from epicodus to work for a tech company that operates internationally. </li>
            <li> I just got a puppy! My best friend is a 5 month old goldendoodle named Murphy. </li>
